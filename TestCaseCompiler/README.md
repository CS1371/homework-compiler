# CS1371 Test Case Generator

The test case generator is a tool used by CS1371 Homework Team members to create test cases for homework problems, and is primarily responsible for ensuring validity of test cases, compiling packages for problems, and uploading these packages to Google Drive to be used by the [homework compiler](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/homework-compiler) and ultimately by the [autograder](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/autograder).

## Documentation

All documentation can be found at [the wiki](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/homework-compiler/wiki) and in SPECIFICATION.md.
