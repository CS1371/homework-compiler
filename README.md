# Homework Compiler

The **Homework Compiler** comprises two programs: the `Test Case Compiler` and the `Homework Compiler`. Both are detailed below, but you can also look at their individual READMEs and wiki pages.

## System requirements

MATLAB R2018 or higher is strongly recommended. Versions of R2017 have seen apparent success, but insufficient testing has been done to ensure complete functionality.

## Building and installation

### Test Case Compiler

Run `build.m` in the Test Case Compiler directory. Once it finishes, double-click the resulting `.mlapp` file to install the Test Case Compiler as a MATLAB app. It should then show up in the apps list and be runnable from there.

### Homework Compiler

Run `build.m` in the Homework Compiler directory. Double-click the resulting `.mlapp` file and run from the app toolbar.

## Usage

See [the Test Case Compiler wiki entry](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/homework-compiler/wiki/Test-Case-Compiler) and [the Homework Compiler wiki entry](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/homework-compiler/wiki/Homework-Compiler) for instructions.
