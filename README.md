# Homework Compiler

The **Homework Compiler** is actually _two_ products: the `Test Case Compiler` and the `Assignment Compiler`. Both are detailed below, but you can also look at their individual READMEs.

## Test Case Compiler

The `Test Case Compiler` is responsible for collecting all the test cases needed for a single `Problem`. This means it formally defines everything needed to run and grade the `Problem`. For a complete list, refer to the `Test Case Compiler` documentation.

## Assignment Compiler

The `Assignment Compiler` pulls together a set of `Problem`s, and creates a single, cohesive definition for the assignment. This compiler then repackages that for all the different necessary distributions.
